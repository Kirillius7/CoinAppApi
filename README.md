# About the project
This project is a web application designed to track and manage data for popular cryptocurrencies. It dynamically fetches up-to-date coin information by utilizing an external API, and this data is then displayed to the user in a clean, user-friendly table format. The application is equipped with a search bar, allowing users to easily find specific coins, and they can sort the table by metrics like coin name or market capitalization for flexible analysis. Furthermore, a refresh feature ensures the table consistently displays the latest market data over time. For in-depth exploration, clicking on any coin navigates the user to a dedicated detail page on a new tab, which provides additional information about the selected cryptocurrency, complete with interactive charts and graphs for comprehensive analysis.

# Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in building a modern, data-driven web application that consumes external services. It was created to showcase skills in full-stack development, including connecting a frontend to a live external API, managing the display of rapidly changing real-time data, and implementing complex data visualization (charts and graphs) in an interactive single-page application experience. The focus is on creating a robust solution for tracking and exploring dynamic financial information.
